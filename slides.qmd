## Introduction

- Nicotine is addictive and harmful. Controlling tobacco use via taxation requires understanding of demand elasticity of the good [@RN].

- Indonesian excise structure is complicated, with various bracket based on firms' production size and types of cigarettes.

- It happes amid various target: demand control, revenue generation, and jobs generation.

- In this project, we are tasked to see whether substitution happened.

## Tax structure {.m}

| type/category | Production | HJE (kIDR) | tariff (kIDR) | AVE(%) |
|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|
| SKM1 | \> 3 billion | 1.95 | .985 | 50.51 |
| SKM2 | \<= 3 billion | 1.14 | .6 | 52.63 |
| SPM1 | \> 3 billion | 2.005 | 1.065 | 53.12 |
| SPM2 | \<= 3 billion | 1.135 | .635 | 55.94 |
| SKT1a | \> 2 billion | \>1.635 | .44 | 26.91 |
| SKT1b | \> 2 billion | \>1.135 | .345 | 30.4 |
| SKT2 | (0.5 \< x \< 2) billion | \>600 | .205 | 34.2 |
| SKT3 | \<= 0.5 billion | \>505 | .115 | 22.77 |

## The tax structure

- The tax structure is lower than what WHO suggests [@prasetyo618].

- The "job" goal leads to a lower tax rate for lower production firm which encourage larger firms to shrink (or at least discourage small firms to go large)

- The "job creation" goal may undermine the "revenue" goal and "control" goal. 

## Data {.m}

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)
library(modelsummary)
dat<-read_excel("use.xlsx")
datu<-dat|>select(qskm1,tskm1,rskm1,lskm1,pskm1)

datasummary(qskm1+rskm1+tskm1+lskm1+pskm1~
              Mean+SD+N+Histogram,
            data=datu)
```

We have monthly data on production and excise from 2014-2023 except for market price. Small degree of freedom compared to the tax brackett.

## Market Prices

```{r}
dut<-dat|>select(mo,pskm1,pskm2,pspm1,pspm2,pskt1a,pskt1b,pskt2,pskt3)
dut<-dut|>pivot_longer(!mo,names_to = "kind",values_to = "value")
dut|>ggplot(aes(x=mo,y=value,color=kind))+geom_line(data=dut[!is.na(dut$value),])+geom_point()+
  theme_classic()
```

## Base price

```{r}
dut<-dat|>select(mo,lskm1,lskm2,lspm1,lspm2,lskt1a,lskt1b,lskt2,lskt3)
dut<-dut|>pivot_longer(!mo,names_to = "kind",values_to = "value")
dut|>ggplot(aes(x=mo,y=value,color=kind))+geom_line(size=1.1)
```

## Market price per stick

## Tariff per stick

## Analysis

- There are clear negative trend on the higher tariff brackett, positive trend on the lower tariff brackett.

- There is an important cutoff point on early 2018, coincident with the divergence point of the base price.

- Quantity: Hand-rolled kretek (SKT) catched up with the machine kretek (SKM). Limited growth in revenue. Jobs is unclear, but since SKT is more labor intensive, it is possible we have net positive on labor absorption.

- "Control" goal doesn't seem to progress.

- Use limited (but monthly) box price

- cross-price seems strong.

- filtered=machine is assumed.

- No information how much stick in the box.

## Conclusion

- Cannot say too strongly on "substitution" amid price data limitation. E-cigs may have effects, but also no data.

- More granular data (both firms and retail) would be necessary.

- But support towards substitution is there, with indicative price elasticity of substitution at 5%.

    - without quantity per box, hard to say tax elasticity.
